# Task Manager

## Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

Hello,

thank you for checking my solution, unfortunately I didn't have (and won't have in near future) enough time to finalize it - I've decided to send you "what I have" already as I don't know if I will be able to complete it soon (I am very sorry for that).

The basic functionality and styling is there, it's missing totally testing & ARIA part.

My plan for the future for this repo (in that particular order):

- add custom service mock that will emulate fetching data from 3rd party source,
- add drag and drop functionality that changes Task status,
- add filtering,
- add custom styles for outdated (over due date) Tasks,
- Unit Tests (Vitest),
- Storybook integration

Best regards,

Lukasz
